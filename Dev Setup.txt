Context: Infrastructure Setup So Far I have manually provisioned a new Development environment in the Firebase Console to separate "Dev" from "Prod".

New Project: Created wispchat-dev.

Services Enabled:

Authentication: Enabled Email/Password. Created dummy accounts (test@wisp.com, admin@wisp.com).

Firestore: Enabled in region asia-south1. Applied production-mirror security rules.

Storage: Skipped for now.

Goal: I now need to configure my local environment to talk to this new project safely without breaking my main branch.

Task: Local Branching & Deployment Please execute the following terminal commands to set up the local workspace:

Git Safety:

Create and switch to a new git branch named feature/dev-environment.

Reason: This ensures any config changes (like .firebaserc) don't accidentally get pushed to main until tested.

Firebase CLI Configuration:

Run firebase use --add to link the new remote project (wispchat-dev) to this directory.

Set the alias for this project as dev.

Run firebase use dev to confirm we are targeting the sandbox.

Deploy Logic:

Run firebase deploy --only functions to push the existing backend logic to the new wispchat-dev cloud environment.
